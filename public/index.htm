					<h5>Carmel Cube Day</h5>
					<p>The <a href="results.htm#ccdmay2312">Carmel Cube Day</a> cubing competition took place on Wednesday, May 23rd, 2012, at Our
					Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School. A total of 20 cubers competed in five different events. The day was a blast and 
					<a href="results.htm#ccdmay2312">results</a> are now posted. Congratulations to all participants and thank you for your enthusiasm!<p>
					<p>Quite a lot of preparation went in to this day, so there are many thank yous to be made. First of all, thank you to Chloe Rose
					and Halina Rose for the great work they did preparing and setting up the amazing decorations for the foyer, as well as the complimentary snacks that
					everyone enjoyed. No expression of gratitude is enough for what you both did for the day!</p>
					<p>Next, a thank you to those who helped with the execution of the cubing, including:
					<a href="http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011MURR01" target="_blank">Matthew Murray</a>, Bryan Melchior, Nicholas Murray, 
					Jason Perry, and <a href="http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011JOZS01" target="_blank">Shawn Jozsa</a>. 
					Thank you all for judging, scrambling, and sharing your cubes, the day would have been ten times more
					overwhelming without your help!</p>
					<p>As for the results of the competition, 
					<a href="http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011ROSE03" target="_blank">Michael Rose</a> won the 3x3 event with an
					average of 16.46 seconds. <a href="http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011MURR01" target="_blank">Matthew Murray</a> placed
					second with an average of 33.44, and <a href="http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2011ANTO03" target="_blank">Ashley Antony</a>
					placed third with an average of 37.81. Once again, congratulations to all participants, the full <a href="results.htm#ccdmay2312">results</a>
					from all events are now posted.</p>
					<p>A final thank you to everyone who was a part of the day in any way. As I'm sure we will all attest, it was quite an impressive show,
					evident from the masses of non-cubers gawking at our solves. I cannot say how proud I am of everyone who has been a part of cubing club
					this year. Thank you all for your support, and I would say that we managed to put on a fantastic final time trials! Hopefully, pictures from
					the day will soon be posted on the site, Facebook, or both, so keep an eye out for those!</p>
					<p>On a final note, the Most Improved Cuber Award will be handed out next week at X-Awards, based on 
					<a href="results.htm#ttfeb1612">February time trials</a> and the
					results from yesterday. The winner will receive a prize pack courtesy of the OLMC Rubik's Cube Club.</p>
					<p>There will likely be one last send-off meeting for cubing club, stay tuned for when that will take place. Until then, happy cubing to all!</p>

					<p>Plans are in the works to hold the Mount Carmel Open, 2012, in early- to mid-June. This full-day event will consist
					of many events, lots of snacks, and as many competitors as we can muster. Hopefully we will get permission to hold
					it in the foyer, so we'll have a good number of spectators as well. Stay tuned for more info!</p>
